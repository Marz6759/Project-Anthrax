#Welcome to the Hardware Development site!

How to get started:
===================

   There are two sections here, the GD (Graphics Designing) and the BD (Board Designing).
Board Designing is the place where all of our blueprints for the electronics will go,
whereas the Graphics Designing is the place where all of our quadcopter case and external view will go.
The reference folders that are labeled as Drone, Pixycam, and Raspberry Pi MUST be used for reference. 



Important things to note while working:
=======================================

1) For GD members, save your 3D designs to .stl format. Also, make sure the design is TO-SCALE.
2) For BD members, most of you will be working online. So save your reports and screenshots of 
   the board to the BD section.
